# Timesheets

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Test User:
Email: alice@example.com
Password: password1234

This is a non manager user. As of right now a create manager option is not available. But when there is a manager that is created, only managers will be able to create other users. To show the functionality, I have included this option for normal worker users as well for tests.
